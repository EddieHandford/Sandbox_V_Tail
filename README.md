# Sandbox_V_Tail

Brief:
An Open Source RC Glider designed to be an "sandbox" platform for people to experiment with, contribute to or to simply enjoy and share.

Scope:
This project is to provide a "Sandbox" Model Aeroplane platform that people can get involved with, creating multiple avenues of engagement/challenges/oppurtunties
Some people way want to contribute mechanically to the design, For example developing a new nose cone, another person may want to develop software for the BBC Micro:bit or develop a custom pcb! Or some people may just want to download the files, and make their own kit! 
Theres no right or wrong, its purely a project that allows for multiple discipline of engineering to meet and develop something benificial for the community.

The platform should always be designed with ease of use as priority, as the goal is to get as many people as possible excited about engineering an the world of flight. Clear documentation is key. For example, the current fuselage is an aluminum tube, although a carbon fibre tube is mechanically better, it is signiifcantly more expensive, in order to make the project as accesible as possible, keeping the cost down is more important then marginally performance gains, this isnt a glider designed for breaking world records, its designed to be a first glider or a development platform.



Project Goals/Milestones:

Goal 1: Design, Manufacture and Test Fly a free flight glider 
Goal 2: Make the glider remote controlled (2 channel only)
Goal 2.5: Produce a purchaseable kit form of the model with build instructions
Goal 3: Add a BBC Micro:Bit to control the V Tail and produce software with basic functionality which works either standalone or in conjunction with an RX(such as compass hold)
Goal 4: Add a winch launch hook for bungee launch
Goal 5: Add a motor pod for manual, powered flight  (note, doenst need to be limited to electric, it could be piston engine).

Restrictions:

Power:
The use of a motor must be limited to only manual control, the motor control must never be controlled by a flight controller. Rationale: Adding a motor to a system with any form of onboard flight controller/compute is too close to other projects such as Ardupilot , and is too easy to result in fly aways or misuse of the platform.

**Miltary Use**:
This Project must never be used for miltary applications, no interation of it, no derivative of it, no excuses.
